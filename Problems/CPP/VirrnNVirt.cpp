// virtual does is to give you polymorphism, that is, the ability to select at run - time the most - derived override of a method.

// What is the output of this program ?

// Base NonVirtual called.Base Virtual called.Base NonVirtual called.Derived Virtual called.

// Derived overrides every method of Base
// : not just the virtual one,
// but also the non - virtual.

// We see that when you have a Base -
// pointer - to - Derived(bDerived),
// calling NonVirtual calls the Base class implementation.This is resolved at compile - time : the compiler sees that bDerived is a Base *, that NonVirtual is not virtual, so it does the resolution on class Base.

// However,
// calling Virtual calls the Derived class implementation.Because of the keyword virtual,
// the selection of the method happens at run - time, not compile - time.What happens here at compile - time is that the compiler sees that this is a Base *, and that it's calling a virtual method, so it insert a call to the vtable instead of class Base. This vtable is instantiated at run-time, hence the run-time resolution to the most-derived override.

// I hope this wasn't too confusing. In short, any method can be overridden, but only virtual
// methods give you polymorphism, that is, run-time selection of the most derived override.
// In practice, however, overriding a non-virtual method is considered bad practice and rarely
// used, so many people (including whoever wrote that Wikipedia article) think that only virtual methods can be overridden.

// Consider the following code :

#include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

class Base
{
  public:
    void NonVirtual()
    {
        cout << "Base NonVirtual called.\n";
    }
    virtual void Virtual()
    {
        cout << "Base Virtual called.\n";
    }
};
class Derived : public Base
{
  public:
    void NonVirtual()
    {
        cout << "Derived NonVirtual called.\n";
    }
    void Virtual()
    {
        cout << "Derived Virtual called.\n";
    }
};

int main()
{
    Base *bBase = new Base();
    Base *bDerived = new Derived();

    bBase->NonVirtual();
    bBase->Virtual();
    bDerived->NonVirtual();
    bDerived->Virtual();
}
